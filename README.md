# Earnings Surprise Tracker

## Project Description

The **Earnings Surprise Tracker** is a full‑stack web application designed to help retail investors and traders quickly understand upcoming earnings events and how companies have historically performed relative to earnings expectations. The application aggregates earnings and earnings‑calendar data from the Alpha Vantage API, stores and manages it using a Supabase PostgreSQL database, and presents insights through an interactive, browser‑based interface.

Users can:

- View upcoming earnings announcements for publicly traded companies  
- Analyze a specific ticker’s recent quarterly EPS surprises  
- Visualize surprise percentages using interactive charts  
- Refresh and persist data to a backend database for reuse

This project was developed as the final group project for **INST 377**, with an emphasis on clear technical communication, system design, and real‑world deployment.

## Target Browsers

This application is designed for modern desktop browsers, including:

- Google Chrome (latest)  
- Safari (latest)  
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)  
- Microsoft Edge (latest)

Mobile responsiveness is partially supported, but the primary target is desktop use.
